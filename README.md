## 📌 About the Project

This project is a web application that visualizes a historical process step-by-step using a graph structure.
Each real-world location is represented as a node, and when clicked, an information box appears showing detailed content.

Through the edit button inside each information box, users can update the data, making the project a fully dynamic and interactive system.
